Eklavya was stunned at Arjuna’s behavior. 
He himself was the son of the 
chief of his clan, 
but he never insulted anyone 
below him in such a way. 
He looked 
at  for some kind of support, 
but the sage remained silent. 
The message was loud 
and clear. 
also wanted him to leave. 
He refused to teach him.  
The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt 
by  refusal to teach him. 
“It’s not fair!” he thought miserably. 
“God has given knowledge to all, 
but man alone differentiates his kind.”
He left the place with 
a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth 
But it could not shatter his 
ambition to learn Archery 
He was still as determined to learn 
Archery. 
I may be a Shudra but does it make any 
difference thought he. 
I am as strong and zealous 
as  princes and disciples. 
If I practice the art every day, 
I can surely become an archer.
reached his own forests and took some 
mud from a nearby river. 
He made a statue of and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. 
believed that if he practiced before his Guru, 
he would become an able archer. 
Thus, though his Guru shunned him, 
he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his Guru.
Day after day, 
he took his bow and arrow, 
worshiped the statue of  and started practice. 
In time faith, courage and perseverance
 transformed Eklavya the mere tribal hunter into
 Eklavya the extraordinary archer. 
Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, 
superior even to  best pupil, Arjuna.
One day while Eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy ignored the dog, but the continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking.  Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, Eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog’s mouth without injuring it. As a result, it roamed the forests with its mouth opened.
But Eklavya was not alone in his practice. 
He was unaware of the fact that just some 
distance away, 
the Pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. 
As fate would have it, 
that day, 
they had come with their teacher, 
who was instructing them about some 
finer points of archery 
by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle.
As they were busy practicing, 
they suddenly chanced upon the “stuffed” dog, 
and wonder who could have 
pulled off such a feat of archery.  
was amazed too.”  Such an 
excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer. 
he exclaimed. 
He told the Pandavas that if somebody 
was such a good archer 
then he surely needed to be met. 
The practice was stopped and together they 
began searching the 
forest for the one behind such amazing feat. 
They found a dark-skinned 
man dressed all in black, his 
body besmeared with filth and his 
hair in matted locks. 
It was Eklavya.  went up to him.
“Yes, Dronacharya”, replied the boy. 
“After I left your Gurukul, 
I came home and made a 
statue like you and worshiped it every day. 
I practiced before your image. 
You refused to teach me, 
but your statue did not. 
Thanks to it, 
I have become a good archer.”
Hearing this
became 
angry. 
But you promised me that you’d make me 
the best archer in the world 
he accused Drona. 
Now how can that be 
Now a common hunter has become better than me
The other princes remembered their master 
frequently praising 
Arjuna that he had immense 
talent and will be the 
greatest archer in the kingdom 
They waited with bated breath. 
What will their teacher do now
Once upon a time a wise lion lived in the jungle.  
He was always respected for his 
intelligence 
and 
kindness.  
All the animals used to 
go to him to discuss their problems.  
He was the best king they could 
ever 
had.
a few miles away from the 
jungle 
there was an empty cave.  
All the animals 
knew it was 
deserted and nobdy 
lived there.  
But, one 
day they saw a monster entering 
the cave.  
The monster was very evil 
and wanted to eat the 
animals but nobody would talk to him.  
So, 
he decided to invite all the 
animals to the 
cave for a party and later eat them.  
He knew the king of the jungle was very 
wise and he would not allow any 
animal to come to the party so 
he did not invite him.  
He also knew how brave and strong 
the lion was so he was really scared of him.
All the animals 
got ready for the party and 
gathered at a place to go to the cave.  
But, 
Zebra 
pointed out that the King 
of the Jungle was missing, 
so they all went to the 
lion to ask him to go with them. 
Lion saw all the 
animals 
together and asked them where they were going.  
When they told him about the party he 
immediately understood the 
monster’s plan so he told all the 
animals to wait here and 
he went to the cave alone
Seeing the lion, 
monster 
got really scared and tried to 
run but the lion caught him.  
The monster asked for forgiveness but the 
lion only forgave him on 
the condition that he would leave the cave 
and never come back.  
So, the monster agreed and left.
All the 
thanked the lion for 
saving them from the 
monster and lived happily together.
Once upon a time a wise lion lived in the jungle.  
He was always respected for his 
intelligence 
and 
kindness.  
All the animals used to 
go to him to discuss their problems.  
He was the best king they could 
ever 
had.
a few miles away from the 
jungle 
there was an empty cave.  
All the animals 
knew it was 
deserted and nobdy 
lived there.  
But, one 
day they saw a monster entering 
the cave.  
The monster was very evil 
and wanted to eat the 
animals but nobody would talk to him.  
So, 
he decided to invite all the 
animals to the 
cave for a party and later eat them.  
He knew the king of the jungle was very 
wise and he would not allow any 
animal to come to the party so 
he did not invite him.  
He also knew how brave and strong 
the lion was so he was really scared of him.
All the animals 
got ready for the party and 
gathered at a place to go to the cave.  
But, 
Zebra 
pointed out that the King 
of the Jungle was missing, 
so they all went to the 
lion to ask him to go with them. 
Lion saw all the 
animals 
together and asked them where they were going.  
When they told him about the party he 
immediately understood the 
monster’s plan so he told all the 
animals to wait here and 
he went to the cave alone
Seeing the lion, 
monster 
got really scared and tried to 
run but the lion caught him.  
The monster asked for forgiveness but the 
lion only forgave him on 
the condition that he would leave the cave 
and never come back.  
So, the monster agreed and left.
All the 
thanked the lion for 
saving them from the 
monster and lived happily together.

Once upon a time, 
there was a 
Kingdom
The 
king 
there only had one 
leg 
and one 
eye
but he was very 
intelligent 
and 
kind. 
Everyone in his kingdom 
lived a 
happy 
and a 
healthy life because 
of their king
One day the king 
was 
walking through the 
palace hallway 
and saw the 
portraits 
of his 
ancestors 
He thought 
that one day 
his 
children 
will walk in the 
same hallway 
and remember 
all the 
ancestors 
through 
these 
portraits.
But, the king 
did not have his portrait painted
Due to his 
physical disabilities
he wasn’t sure 
how his painting would turn out. 
So he invited many famous 
painters 
from his and 
other kingdoms 
to the court. 
The king then announced 
that he wants a 
beautiful 
portrait made of himself to be placed in the palace. 
Any painter who can carry out 
this should come forward. 
He will be rewarded based 
on how the painting turns up.
All of the painters 
began to think that the 
king 
only has one leg and one eye. 
How can his picture be made very 
beautiful? 
It is not possible and if 
the picture does not turn out to look 
beautiful then 
the king will get angry and punish 
them. So one by 
one, all started to make 
excuses and politely declined to make 
a painting of the king.
But suddenly 
one painter 
raised his 
hand and said that 
I will make 
a very 
beautiful portrait of 
you which you 
will surely like. 
The king became happy 
hearing that and other painters got curious. 
The king gave him the 
permission and the painter started drawing the 
portrait. 
He then filled the drawing with paints. 
Finally
after taking a long time 
he said that the 
portrait was ready!
All of the courtiers
other painters were 
curious and nervous thinking 
How can the painter make the king’s portrait beautiful 
because the king is physically disabled? 
What if the king didn’t like the painting and gets angry? 
But when the painter presented the portrait, 
everyone in the court, including the king, 
left stunned.
The painter made a portrait in which the king 
was sitting on the 
horse

horse on the one leg side
holding his bow 
and aiming the arrow 
with his one eye closed. 
The king was very pleased 
to see that the painter 
has made a beautiful portrait by cleverly hiding the king’s disabilities.
The King gave him a great 
reward

There was a country long time ago 
where the people 
would change a 
king every 
year. 
The person who would become 
the king had to agree to a contract 
that he would be sent to an island 
after his one year of being a king.
One king finished his term and it was time 
for him to go to the 
island and live there 
The people dressed him up in 
expensive clothes and put him on 
an elephant and took him around the 
cities to say goodbye to all the people. 
This was the moment of sadness for 
all the kings who ruled for one year.
After saying farewell, 
the people took the king 
with a boat 
to remote island and 
left him there
On their way back
they discovered a ship that 
had sunk just recently 
They saw a young man 
who survived by holding on 
to a floating piece of 
wood
As they needed a new king
they picked up the 
young man and 
took him to their country.
They requested him to be a king for a year. 
First he refused but later he agreed to be a king. 
People told him about all the rules 
and regulations and that how he 
will be sent to an island after one year.
After 
three days of being a king
 he asked the ministers 
if they could show him the 
island where all the 
other kings were sent. 
They agreed and took him 
to the island. 
The island was 
covered with thick 
Jungles and sounds 
of vicious animals were heard coming out of them. 
The king went little bit 
inside to check. 
Soon he discovered the dead bodies of all 
the past kings. 
He understood that as soon as they were left in the island, 
the animals came and killed them.
The king went 
back to the country and collected 
100 strong workers 
He took them to the island 
and instructed them to clean the Jungle 
and remove all the deadly 
animals & cut down all excess trees.
He 
would visit the 
island every month to 
see how the 
work was progressing. 
In the first month all the animals were removed and many trees were cut down. 
In the second month, the whole island was cleaned out. 
The king then told the workers to plant gardens in various parts of the island.
He also 
took with himself useful animals like 
chickens
ducks 
birds
goats 
cows etc
In the third month, 
he ordered the workers to 
build big houses and docking stations for ships. 
Over the months, the island turned into a beautiful place.
The young king 
would wear simple clothes and spend 
very little from his earnings as a king 
He sent all the 
earnings to the island for storage 
When nine months 
passed like this 
the clever king called 
the ministers and told them,
“I know that I have to go the island after one year. 
But I would like to go there right now."
But the ministers 
didn’t agree to this and said that he has to wait for 
another 3 months to complete the year. 
3 months passed and now it was a full year. 
The people dressed up the young king 
and put him on an elephant to take him around the country to say goodbye to others. 
However, this king is unusually happy to leave the kingdom.
People asked him, 
All the other kings would cry at this moment and why are you laughing
The Clever King replied, 
“Don’t you know what the wise people say? 
They say that when you 
came to this world as a baby, you were
crying 
and everyone was smiling
Live such a life that when you are die,
you will be smiling and everyone around you will be crying. 
I haw lived that life
While all the other kings were 
lost into the luxuries of the kingdom 
I always thought about the future and planned for it. 
I turned the deadly island into a 
beautiful
abode for me where I can stay peacefully."
The moral 
lesson from this story is about 
how we should live our life 
The life of this world is to 
prepare for the life hereafter
In this life we shouldn’t get 
lost into the deceiving and attractive 
things of this world 
and forget about what is to 
come in the afterlife 
Rather, even if we are kings 
we should live a simple life and save all 
our enjoyments for the hereafter. 
May HE make it easy for us all?
It is 
He Who sends down 
rain and He 
Who knows what is 
in the wombs. 
Nor does any one know what it 
is that he will earn on the morro 
Nor does any one know in what 
land he is to 
die

This is the story of a long-gone era. 
In the country of India, 
nearly five thousand years back, 
lived a boy named Eklavya, 
the son of a tribal chief in the 
forests of the kingdom
Hastinapura. 
Eklavya was a brave, 
handsome boy. He was loved by all. 
But he was not happy.
His father saw that something troubled 
 More than once he 
found his son lost deep in thought 
when other boys enjoyed the pleasures 
of hunting and playing. 
One day the father asked his son, 
Why are you so unhappy, 
Why don t you join your friends
Why are you not interested in hunting?
Father
I want to be an 
archer replied 
I want to become 
a disciple of the great 
great tutor of 
Archery in 
His Gurukul 
is a magical place where ordinary 
boys are turned into mighty warriors.
saw his father was silent
He continued 
Father, 
I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, 
but I want to be a warrior
father, not a mere hunter. 
So please allow me to leave home 
and become the disciple of 
father was troubled, 
for he knew that his son’s ambition was not an easy one. 
But the chief was a loving 
father and he did not want to refuse 
his only son’s wish. 
So the kind man gave his blessings 
and sent his son on his way to Drona s Gurukul
Eklavya set on his way. 
Soon he reached the part of the 
forest where Drona 
taught the princes of Hastinapur.
In those days, 
there was no such system as a school, 
college, university 
or hostel. 
The only place where one 
could get some education was a Gurukul . 
A Gurukul a type of 
ancient 
Hindu school 
in India that is 
residential in nature with the shishyas or 
students and the guru or 
teacher living in proximity
many a time within the same 
house. The Gurukul is the 
place where the students resided 
together as equals, 
irrespective of their social standing. 
The students learned from the guru and also 
helped the guru in 
his day-to-day life 
including the carrying out of 
mundane chores such as washing 
clothes, cooking, etc. 
The education imparted thus, 
was a wholesome one.
Having said this 
much let us now return to 
When the boy reached 
Gurukul
he saw that it consisted of a group of huts
surrounded by trees 
and an archery yard
The disciples were practicing to shoot 
arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. 
It was an engaging sight. 
But Eklavya s eyes searched Drona. 
Where was he
Will he be able to see the man
Without Drona, 
all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless
But all his worries soon subsided
He did not have to wait for long. 
There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy
who was none else than the third 
Pandava prince Arjuna 
as Eklavya came to know later 
Though Eklavya had never 
seen Drona before, he put his guess at work. 
He went near Drona and bowed. 
The sage was surprised to see a strange
boy addressing him. 
Who are you?he asked.
Drona sighed. if you are a tribal hunter, 
you must be a Shudra, 
the lowest social community according 
to the Vedic Caste System. 
I am a Brahmin, the highest caste 
in the kingdom. I 
cannot teach a Shudra boy he said
And he’s also 
a Royal teacher
interrupted Prince Arjuna. 
Our Guru has been 
appointed by the King to train 
us, the princes and the highborn
How dare you come inside 
the Gurukul and seek him 
Leave! NOW he spat out, 
looking enraged that Eklavya had disturbed his practice.
Once upon a time, 
there was a 
Kingdom
The 
king 
there only had one

First he refused but later he agreed to be a king. 
People told him about all the rules 
and regulations and that how he 
will be sent to an island after one year.
After 
three days of being a king
 he asked the ministers 
if they could show him the 
island where all the 
other kings were sent. 
They agreed and took him 
to the island. 
The island was 
covered with thick 
Jungles and sounds 
of vicious animals were heard coming out of them. 
The king went little bit 
inside to check. 
Soon he discovered the dead bodies of all 
the past kings. 
He understood that as soon as they were left in the island, 
the animals came and killed them.
The king went 
back to the country and collected 
100 strong workers 
He took them to the island 
and instructed them to clean the Jungle 
and remove all the deadly 
animals & cut down all excess trees.
He 
would visit the 
island every month to 
see how the 
work was progressing. 
In the first month all the animals were removed and many trees were cut down. 
In the second month, the whole island was cleaned out. 
The king then told the workers to plant gardens in various parts of the island.
He also 
took with himself useful animals like 
chickens
 ducks 
birds
goats 
cows etc
 In the third month, 
he ordered the workers to 
build big houses and docking stations for ships. 
Over the months, the island turned into a beautiful place.
The young king 
would wear simple clothes and spend 
very little from his earnings as a king 
He sent all the 
earnings to the island for storage 
When nine months 
passed like this 
the clever king called 
the ministers and told them,
“I know that I have to go the island after one year. 
But I would like to go there right now."
But the ministers 
didn’t agree to this and said that he has to wait for 
another 3 months to complete the year. 
3 months passed and now it was a full year. 
The people dressed up the young king 
and put him on an elephant to take him around the country to say goodbye to others. 
However, this king is unusually happy to leave the kingdom.
People asked him, 
All the other kings would cry at this moment and why are you laughing
The Clever King replied, 
“Don’t you know what the wise people say? 
They say that when you 
came to this world as a baby, you were
crying 
and everyone was smiling
Live such a life that when you are die,
you will be smiling and everyone around you will be crying. 
I haw lived that life
While all the other kings were 
lost into the luxuries of the kingdom 
I always thought about the future and planned for it. 
I turned the deadly island into a 
beautiful
abode for me where I can stay peacefully."
The moral 
lesson from this story is about 
how we should live our life 
The life of this world is to 
prepare for the life hereafter
In this life we shouldn’t get 
lost into the deceiving and attractive 
things of this world 
and forget about what is to 
come in the afterlife 
Rather, even if we are kings 
we should live a simple life and save all 
our enjoyments for the hereafter. 
May HE make it easy for us all?
It is 
He Who sends down 
rain and He 
Who knows what is 
in the wombs. 
Nor does any one know what it 
is that he will earn on the morro 
Nor does any one know in what 
land he is to 
die
die
die
You ruined your next world and developed this one. 
Naturally, you do not like 
to be transferred from flourishing to decline.

This is the story of a long-gone era. 
In the country of India, 
nearly five thousand years back, 
lived a boy named Eklavya, 
the son of a tribal chief in the 
forests of the kingdom
Hastinapura. 
Eklavya was a brave, 
handsome boy. He was loved by all. 
But he was not happy.
His father saw that something troubled 
 More than once he 
found his son lost deep in thought 
when other boys enjoyed the pleasures 
of hunting and playing. 
One day the father asked his son, 
Why are you so unhappy, 
Why don t you join your friends
Why are you not interested in hunting?
Father
I want to be an 
archer replied 
I want to become 
a disciple of the great 
great tutor of 
Archery in 
His Gurukul 
is a magical place where ordinary 
boys are turned into mighty warriors.
saw his father was silent
 He continued 
Father, 
I know that we belong to the hunting tribe, 
but I want to be a warrior
father, not a mere hunter. 
So please allow me to leave home 
and become the disciple of 
father was troubled, 
for he knew that his son’s ambition was not an easy one. 
But the chief was a loving 
father and he did not want to refuse 
his only son’s wish. 
So the kind man gave his blessings 
and sent his son on his way to Drona s Gurukul
Eklavya set on his way. 
Soon he reached the part of the 
forest where Drona 
taught the princes of Hastinapur.
In those days, 
there was no such system as a school, 
college, university 
or hostel. 
The only place where one 
could get some education was a Gurukul . 
A Gurukul a type of 
ancient 
Hindu school 
in India that is 
residential in nature with the shishyas or 
students and the guru or 
teacher living in proximity
many a time within the same 
house. The Gurukul is the 
place where the students resided 
together as equals, 
irrespective of their social standing. 
The students learned from the guru and also 
helped the guru in 
his day-to-day life 
including the carrying out of 
mundane chores such as washing 
clothes, cooking, etc. 
The education imparted thus, 
was a wholesome one.
Having said this 
much let us now return to 
When the boy reached 
Gurukul
he saw that it consisted of a group of huts
  surrounded by trees 
and an archery yard
The disciples were practicing to shoot 
arrows with their bows and arrows in the yard. 
It was an engaging sight. 
But Eklavya s eyes searched Drona. 
Where was he
Will he be able to see the man
Without Drona, 
all his purpose of coming here would be meaningless
 But all his worries soon subsided
He did not have to wait for long. 
There was the man standing near a tree busy instructing a boy
who was none else than the third 
Pandava prince Arjuna 
as Eklavya came to know later 
Though Eklavya had never 
seen Drona before, he put his guess at work. 
He went near Drona and bowed. 
The sage was surprised to see a strange
boy addressing him. 
Who are you?he asked.
Drona sighed. if you are a tribal hunter, 
you must be a Shudra, 
the lowest social community according 
to the Vedic Caste System. 
I am a Brahmin, the highest caste 
in the kingdom. I 
cannot teach a Shudra boy he said
“And he’s also 
a Royal teacher
interrupted Prince Arjuna. 
“Our Guru has been 
appointed by the King to train 
us, the princes and the highborn
How dare you come inside 
the Gurukul and seek him 
Leave! NOW he spat out, 
looking enraged that Eklavya had disturbed his practice.
Eklavya was stunned at Arjuna’s behavior. 
He himself was the son of the 
chief of his clan, 
but he never insulted anyone 
below him in such a way. 
He looked 
at  for some kind of support, 
but the sage remained silent. 
The message was loud 
and clear. 
also wanted him to leave. 
He refused to teach him.  
The innocent tribal boy was deeply hurt 
by  refusal to teach him. 
“It’s not fair!” he thought miserably. 
“God has given knowledge to all, 
but man alone differentiates his kind.”
He left the place with 
a broken heart and a bitter taste in his mouth 
But it could not shatter his 
ambition to learn Archery 
He was still as determined to learn 
Archery. 
I may be a Shudra but does it make any 
difference thought he. 
I am as strong and zealous 
as  princes and disciples. 
If I practice the art every day, 
I can surely become an archer.
reached his own forests and took some 
mud from a nearby river. 
He made a statue of  and selected a secluded clearing in the forests to place it. 
Eklavya did this because he faithfully 
believed that if he practiced before his Guru, 
he would become an able archer. 
Thus, though his Guru shunned him, 
he still held him in high esteem and thought of him as his Guru.
Day after day, 
he took his bow and arrow, 
worshiped the statue of  and started practice. 
In time faith, courage and perseverance
 transformed Eklavya the mere tribal hunter into
 Eklavya the extraordinary archer. 
Eklavya became an archer of exceptional prowess, 
superior even to  best pupil, Arjuna.
One day while Eklavya is practicing, he hears a dog barking. At first, the boy ignored the dog, but the continuous disturbance in his practice angered him. He stopped his practice and went towards the place where the dog was barking.  Before the dog could shut up or get out of the way, Eklavya fired seven arrows in rapid succession to fill the dog’s mouth without injuring it. As a result, it roamed the forests with its mouth opened.
But Eklavya was not alone in his practice. 
He was unaware of the fact that just some 
distance away, 
the Pandava princes were also present in that area of the forest. 
As fate would have it, 
that day, 
they had come with their teacher, 
who was instructing them about some 
finer points of archery 
by making them learn in the real-life condition of the open jungle.
As they were busy practicing, 
they suddenly chanced upon the “stuffed” dog, 
and wonder who could have 
pulled off such a feat of archery.  
was amazed too.”  Such an 
excellent aim can only come from a mighty archer. 
he exclaimed. 
He told the Pandavas that if somebody 
was such a good archer 
then he surely needed to be met. 
The practice was stopped and together they 
began searching the 
forest for the one behind such amazing feat. 
They found a dark-skinned 
man dressed all in black, his 
body besmeared with filth and his 
hair in matted locks. 
It was Eklavya.  went up to him.
“Yes, Dronacharya”, replied the boy. 
“After I left your Gurukul, 
I came home and made a 
statue like you and worshiped it every day. 
I practiced before your image. 
You refused to teach me, 
but your statue did not. 
Thanks to it, 
I have become a good archer.”
Hearing this
became 
angry. 
But you promised me that you’d make me 
the best archer in the world 
he accused Drona. 
Now how can that be 
Now a common hunter has become better than me
The other princes remembered their master 
frequently praising 
Arjuna that he had immense 
talent and will be the 
greatest archer in the kingdom 
They waited with bated breath.

 Sounds great!
 That’s wonderful!
 Incredible!
 Wonderful! Thank you for sharing.
 Really? Are you serious?
 I can’t believe that!
I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news for you…
 I’m so sorry but…
 I’m sorry to have to tell you that …
 I know this isn’t what you want to hear but…
 I’m afraid to inform you of …
 It is my unfortunate duty to tell you that …
 I really feel bad to have to say this, but …
 I really don’t know how to say it, but …
Responding to bad news:
 I’m sorry to hear that…
 You must be feeling terrible …
 That’s awful!
 Too bad!
 Poor you!
 Please, accept my deepest sympathy.
 Anytime you need to talk, just call me …
 If there’s anything I can do, just let me know…
 That’s too bad.
 How disappointing!
 That’s so disappointing!
 Oh no, what a shame!
 It’s a great shame.
 It’s a little bit disappointing, isn’t it!
 It didn’t live up to my expectations.
 What a pity!
 What a letdown!
 What a bummer!
 That’s a nuisance!
 I thought you could do better.
 I’ve never been so disappointed in my life.
 It wasn’t as good as I thought it would be.
 How do I…?
 Can you show me how to…?
 Do you know how to…?
 How do I go about…?
 What do you suggest?
 What is the first step?
 What is the best way to…?
Giving instructions:
 First, you…
 Then, you…
 Next, you…
 Lastly, you…
Starting out:
 The first thing you do is…
 Before you begin, (you should…)
 The best place to begin is…
 I would start by…
Continuing:
 After that,
 The next step is to…
 The next thing you do is…
 Once you’ve done that, then…
 When you finish that, then…
Finishing:
 The last step is…
 The last thing you do is…
 In the end,…
 When you’ve finished,…
 When you’ve completed all the steps,…
 It’s your fault.
 It’s your mistake.
 I can’t believe that you did it.
 How could you do such a thing?
 Are you out of your mind?
 What on earth were you thinking?
 I think you are the one to blame.
 I think you are the one who could have done it.
Expressions of Accusing Someone:
 It must have been you who did it.
 I think you’re the only person who could have done it.
 You must be doing something wrong.
Accepting blaming and accusing:
 I’m sorry. It’s my fault.
 I’m sorry for the things I’ve done.
 I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to.
 Sorry for my fault.
 It’s my responsibility. I’m sorry.
 You’re right! It’s my fault. I’m sorry.
Refusing blaming and accusing:
 It’s not true.
 It’s not my fault.
 I’m not the one to blame.
 I didn’t do it.
 You’re wrong. It wasn’t me.
Call me
Some years ago
ever mind how long precisely
having little
no money in my purse
and nothing particular 
to interest me onshore
I thought 
I would sail 
about a little 
see the watery part of the world
It is away 
I have been driving 
off the spleen 
regulating the circulation
Whenever I find myself 
growing grim 
about the mouth
whenever 
it is a damp
drizzly November 
in my soul
I find myself 
involuntarily pausing 
before coffin 
warehouses
bringing up the rear 
of every funeral 
I meet
especially whenever 
my hypos 
get such 
an upper hand of me
it requires a 
the strong moral principle 
to prevent me 
from deliberately stepping 
into the street
methodically 
knocking people
hats off
I account it 
high time 
to get 
to sea 
as soon 
as I can
This is my substitute 
pistol 
With a philosophical 
flourish 
throws himself 
upon his sword
I quietly take to the ship
There is nothing 
surprising in this
If they 
knew it
almost all men 
in their degree
some time 
cherish very nearly 
the same feelings 
towards the ocean 
with me
There now 
your insular city 
belted round 
by wharves 
as Indian isles 
by coral reefs
commerce surrounds 
it with her surf
Right and left
the streets take you 
waterward
Its extreme 
downtown 
It is the battery
that noble mole 
is washed 
by waves
cooled by breezes
a few hours 
previous 
were out of sight 
Look at the crowds 
of water-gazers there
Circumambulate 
the city of a dream
Sabbath afternoon
Go northward
What do you see
Posted like 
silent sentinels 
all around the town
stand thousands 
upon thousands 
mortal men 
fixed in ocean reveries
Some leaning 
against the spiles
some seated 
upon the pier heads
some looking 
over the bulwarks 
Ships from China
Some high aloft 
in the rigging
as if striving 
to get a still 
better seaward peep
These are all landsmen
Weekdays 
pent up 
lath and plaster
tied to counters
nailed
To benches
clinched to desks
How then is this
Are the green fields gone
What do they do here
But look
Here comes 
more crowds
pacing straight 
for the water
seemingly bound 
for a dive
Strange
Nothing will content 
The extremist 
limit of the land
loitering under 
the shady lee 
yonder warehouses 
It will not suffice
They must 
get just as nigh 
the water 
as they possibly can 
without falling in
there they stand
miles of them
leagues
Inlanders 
they come from lanes and alleys
streets and avenues
north east south west
Yet here 
they all unite
Tell me
magnetic virtue 
of the needles 
of the compasses 
of all those ships 
attract them thither
Once more
Say you 
In the country
in some high land of lakes
Take almost any path you please
ten to one 
it carries you down 
in a dale
leaves you there 
by a pool 
in the stream
There is magic in it
Let the most absent minded of men 
be plunged 
in his deepest reveries
stand that man 
on his legs
set his feet 
he will infallibly 
lead you to water
if water 
in all that region
Should you ever 
be athirst 
in the great desert
try this experiment
your caravan 
happen to be supplied 
with a metaphysical professor
as every one knows
meditation and water 
wedded for ever
here is an artist
He desires to paint 
the dreamiest
shadiest
quietest
most enchanting 
bit of romantic 
in all the valley 
What is the chief element he employs
There stand his trees
each with a hollow trunk
as if a hermit 
a crucifix 
were within
here sleeps his meadow
there sleep his cattle
up from yonder cottage 
goes a sleepy smoke
Deep into distant woodlands 
winds a mazy way
reaching to overlapping spurs 
mountains bathed in their hill side blue
Though the picture lies 
thus tranced
though this pine tree shakes down 
its sighs like leaves 
upon this shepherd head
yet all were vain
unless the shepherd
eye were fixed 
upon the magic 
stream before him
Go visit the Prairies 
in June
when for scores 
on scores of miles 
you wade knee deep 
among Tiger lilies
what is the one charm wanting
there is not a drop of water there
Were Niagara 
a cataract of sand
would you travel 
your thousand miles 
to see it
Why did the poor poet of Tennessee
upon suddenly 
receiving two handfuls of silver
deliberate 
whether to buy him a coat
he sadly needed
invest his money 
in a pedestrian trip 
almost every robust healthy boy 
with a robust 
healthy soul in him
at some time 
other crazy 
to go to sea
Why upon your first voyage 
as a passenger
did you yourself feel 
such a mystical vibration
when first told 
that your ship 
now out of sight of land
Why did the old Persians
hold the sea holy
Why did the Greeks 
give it a separate deity
own brother of Jove

One cold rainy day
when my father was a little boy
he met an old alley cat on his street
The cat was very drippy
and uncomfortable 
so my father said
Would you like to come home with me
This surprised the cat
she had never before met anyone 
who cared about old alley cats
she said
I would be very much obliged 
if I could sit by a warm furnace
perhaps have a saucer of milk
We have a very nice furnace to sit by
I am sure my mother has an extra saucer of milk.
My father and the cat
became good friends 
but my father was very upset 
about the cat
She hated cats
particularly ugly
old alley cats
she said to my father
if you think
give that cat 
a saucer of milk
you are very wrong
Once you start feeding
stray alley cats 
you might as well expect 
to feed every stray in town
I am not going to do it
This made my father 
very sad
he apologized to the cat 
his mother had been so rude
He told the cat
stay anyway
that somehow he would bring her
a saucer of milk each day
My father fed the cat
for three weeks
one day his mother found the saucer in the cellar
she was extremely angry
She whipped my father 
threw the cat out the door
later on my father sneaked out 
found the cat
Together they went for a walk
in the park
tried to think of nice things
to talk about
When I grow up 
I am going to have an airplane
Would it be wonderful to fly
just anywhere you might think of
Would you like to fly very much
I certainly would
I would do anything 
if I could fly
Well
If you would really like
to fly that much
I think I know
a sort of away
you might get
to fly while you are still a little boy
You mean you know
where I could 
get an airplane
not exactly an airplane
but something even better
As you can see
I am an old cat
in my younger days
I was quite a traveler
My traveling days are over
last spring I took just one more trip
sailed to a Island 
stopping at the port
it just so happened 
I missed the boat
and while waiting for the next 
I thought I would look around a bit
I was particularly interested
In a place 
which we had passed 
on our way 
joined together 
by a long string of rocks
people never go to Wild Island 
it is mostly jungle 
inhabited by very wild animals
So I decided to go across the rocks
explore it for me
It certainly is an interesting place
I saw something there 
that made me want to weep

that made me want to weep
Aharsi, the big Bengal tiger,
was having a good think
It was 
winter 
and he was still getting used to the feeling of ice on the pads of his paws
He shivered a little, 
missing the warm ooze of mangrove mud.
Aharsi was missing lots of things
He missed the way 
the sun made his 
coat glow a regal orange
or 
how the glare of 
midday 
brightness 
made his black stripes look so 
bold and striking like black 
lightning bolts
He missed dozing in the 
evening 
heat 
and catching the 
last shafts of 
sunlight as they cut 
through the jungle vines
He wondered if 
he 
would 
ever again hear Doyel 
birds chattering 
in the trees
or catch the 
scent of ripe 
mangoes 
on the breeze
It was these fleeting 
poignant moments that 
the Bengal 
tiger was trying so hard to picture in 
his mind
Aharsi 
missed his home.
His whiskers bristled 
as he let out a 
big 
sigh, sending the starlings that 
had been pecking at 
the frozen ground 
scattering up 
into the grey sky
Three 
hours had passed 
and even though 
he 
thought very hard
all the 
tiger 
had managed to 
remember was some 
vague 
half 
images 
of 
mangoes 
and 
mangroves
He was worried 
that he was forgetting 
all about his 
old home 
altogether.
Aharsi first arrived at 
the zoo in 
England with his mother 
and father
was so exciting
He 
lapped it all up
his 
amber eyes burned with 
curiosity as he 
jumped from tree to 
tree or smelled each 
flower or 
pawed at each tiny 
insect.
Now 
just calm down
mother would say
You have come a long way
There is plenty of time to explore
now you must rest
But the young tiger was too busy to rest
There were new animals to meet 
new trees to climb
There was so much to learn about 
his new 
home
Before the sun went down on that first 
day
Aharsi had bounded around all of the animal's cages 
asking them question after 
question, absorbing the 
strange exotic colors of 
the paradise birds and smelling the 
sweet and unfamiliar smell of the 
hay in the rhino stalls
But the more he explored, the more 
Aharsi realized how different his new home was to where he’d come from
And now the young tiger was worried 
that he’d lost all of the precious 
memories he had of his homeland
He was worried that he'd forgotten 
all about being a Bengal tiger.
Aharsi squeezed his eyes closed and 
flicked his tail purposefully from side to side
Remember he told himself
Try to think harder
Hours passed
the day grew dimmer and the rest of the 
animals started to settle down in the twilight
After a while, Aharsi felt someone looking at him
He opened one eye, keen to 
stay as focused as he could
trying to remember, just trying to remember
It was Zody the Leopard What are you doing
came the deep, purring voice
I am remembering, Aharsi answered
Now if you don’t mind
Aharsi closed his eye once more and 
tried to concentrate even harder.
Remembering asked Zody
Yes
I’ve forgotten all about being a 
Bengal tiger, and where I’ve come from, so I’m trying to remember it before it’s all gone forever. Now if you don’t mind
Once again Aharsi squeezed his eyes shut and tried to summon images from his homeland.
‘You won’t get faaar with 
your eeeyes closed,’ said Zody.
Aharsi opened his eyes wide and looked quite annoyed
I won’t get anywhere unless you 
leave me alone to think!’ he said
You wouldn’t understand anyway, 
you’re not even a tiger, let alone a Bengal tiger! You’re a leopard!’
You silly animal said Zody, rattling with laughter
Look there!’ She pointed to a shiny slick patch of ice on the hard ground
Aharsi stared back at Zody in some confusion
I think you may have gone a 
bit bonkers, Zody
he said, and just then he almost wanted to laugh himself.
If you want to remember how to be a tiger,’ said Zody in a kind voice, just look
Fine, if you’ll leave me alone then I’ll look.
Aharsi bent his neck a little and peered into the glassy ice mirror on the ground. Zody purred over his shoulder
What beauuutiful stripes you have 
she said.
When I look into the mirror I see myyy spots. 
Nobody else has spots quite like mine. 
My mother had spots, and my mother’s mother
Once upon a time
there was a beautiful baby girl
who was a 
Vampire 
Princess called 
Draculaura. 
She was
year old. 
She took home school
and one was how to fly
She was best
then she got cursed with a good spell of
when she was she would be cute
famous and pretty
But when she was sixteen
someone got so jealous they decided to kidnap her
on her 17th eve of her birthday
Her base was under the church to listen to prayers
and to get in you had to pay
 a person
She saw the kidnapper 
steal from the church
The kidnapper’s name was Anita
She was a demon
with red eyes
But luckily
Draculaura’s parents figured it out and got 
Draculaura back and lived a happy life
but that’s not the end
Then Anita was back from the police and they said
You have to say sorry
Anita nodded with a bored face
Then she walked up and Anita said
Sorry for kidnapping you and being jealous
Draculaura said
That’s ok Anita
now stop being jealous and anyway
I am a princess
I am meant to be famous
Anita said
Ok I am very absolutely sorry about that incident
Bye Anita,
said Draculaura
See ya later
said Anita
then they went home
They cried in happiness because 
their daughter was back safe and sound
They were very
very happy
They never left their child again
They went on holidays and did fun things like 
swimming
bowling and riding a bike or playing electronics 
together and a lot of fun things all the time forever
plus they got everything free since 
they were royal of course
they protected their kingdom very well
forever and ever and never ever let 
people steal money again.
The end
Once upon a time
a wicked King from a faraway country 
invaded the land where a Queen ruled
The invader King captured the Queen 
and her baby daughter as prisoners
When he returned to his kingdom
he shut them both into the highest 
room of a tall tower
The room was very tiny and bare
with only one table and a very hard bed.
Then the enemy King sent for a 
fairy who lived near his kingdom
He nearly pushed the Fairy up the 
stairs to the Queen's room
The Fairy was touched by the sight of 
the Queen's miserable condition
When she kissed the Queen's hand
the Fairy whispered to her
Courage
madam
I think I see a way to help you
The Queen whispered her thanks
Then the wicked King cried harshly
Silence  He turned to the Fair
I brought you here for one 
reason and one reason only
Tell me this
Will this baby girl grow up to be a 
worthy bride for my son
The Fairy answered that indeed
the Princess would grow up to 
have all the graces
intelligence and charms that 
was in every way worthy of a throne
The old King growled to the 
Queen that it was lucky for 
them both that the Fairy 
had said it would be so
He would save the baby's life 
to become the future bride for his son
From the highest room of the tower the Fairy and Queen could hear the King's son shrieking and demanding that his servants do this and that from way down below, his mean voice carrying over all other voices and noises
The King thundered that if the Fairy had made a different forecast, both the baby and her mother would immediately have been hanged
Then he stamped off
Taking the Fairy with him
and leaving the poor Queen in tears.
How can I wish my little daughter to grow up only to be married to that horrid King's son
she cried
And yet if she were ill-fated
we would both be doomed right now
If only I could hide her away somewhere
anywhere
There must be someplace safe where the cruel King could never find her
But where could the infant be hid
since they were both stuck in that tiny room at the top of the tower
As the days went on
the Queen and the little Princess grew thinner and thinner
For every day
their hard-hearted jailer gave them only three boiled peas each to eat and a tiny morsel of black bread
so they were always terribly hungry
At last
one evening
as the Queen sat at her spinning-wheel - for she was also made to work day and night - she saw a tiny
pretty little mouse creep out of a hole
She said to the mouse
Alas
little creature
Why are you coming here
We have only three peas each per day
So unless you wish to starve I'm afraid you must go elsewhere for your food
But the mouse ran hither and thither
and danced and twirled so prettily
that the Queen clapped and laughed with joy
At last
she gave the mouse her last pea
which she was keeping for her supper
saying
Here
little one
I am sorry I have nothing better to offer you
Your fine dancing deserves far more than this wrinkled little pea
She had hardly spoken
when upon the table appeared a succulent roast partridge and two dishes of preserved fruit
Amazed was she! Quickly the Queen mashed a portion of the meat and fruit and spoon fed her baby
who licked each spoonful with glee
Then the Queen ate with great satisfaction herself
and offered what was left to the little mouse
The mouse danced even more charmingly than ever before
The next morning the jailer brought the Queen and the Princess' daily allowance of three peas each
which he brought in upon a large dish to make them look even smaller
As soon as the jailer left
the Queen gave the mouse all three of her peas
The empty dish was instantly covered with all sorts of wonderful things to eat
and the Queen shared a feast with her daughter once again
But afterwards
as she sat at her spinning-wheel
he began to worry that the fine meals could end any time
and even if they didn't
that her precious daughter was doomed to live as a prisoner
only to be forced to marry that horrid prince when she grew up.
The Queen despaired
Oh! If only I could think of some way to save her
As she spoke
she noticed the little mouse playing in a corner with some long straws
The Queen began to braid the straws
thinking
If I had but enough straws I could make a basket with them
Then if I let my baby down in the basket from the window
perhaps a kind passerby might take care of her and raise her in freedom
One day 
all the animals 
of the 
forest gathered together 
That day was the 
The 
birds
and
animals
of the forest were going to vote
and elect a new king
After voting in the morning
the counting was completed
in the evening.
The 
fox
was declared to be the new king
His competitor the jackal had lost the election.
After losing the election
the jackal wanted to teach the fox a lesson
So he started thinking.
Then he saw a trap set by some 
hunters
They had left some meat
to attract some animal
to the trap.
The jackal
went and told the fox that some meat was 
lying unattended
He could go and eat it. 
The fox rushed to the spot. 
He picked the meat and got caught in the trap.
The jackal
called all the animals
and showed them the fox and said
If a 
king
cannot control his desires
and believes others without thinking
he can never be a good leader
ONCE upon a time
there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess
but she would have to be a real princess
He traveled all over the world to find one
but nowhere could he get what he wanted
There were princesses enough
but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones
there was always something about them that was not as it should be
So he came home again and was sad
for he would have liked very much to have a real princess

One evening a terrible storm came on
there were thunder and lightning
and the rain poured down in torrents
Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate
and the old king went to open it

It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate
But
good gracious
what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look
the water ran down from her hair and clothes
it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels
And yet she said that she was a real princess

Well
we will soon find that out
thought the old queen
But she said nothing, went into the bedroom
took all the bedding off the bedstead
and laid a pea on the bottom
then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea
and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses
On this
the princess had to lie all night
In the morning she was asked how she had slept
Oh
very badly
said she
I have scarcely closed my eyes all night
Heaven only knows what was in the bed
but I was lying on something hard
so that I am black and blue all over my body
It is horrible
Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds
Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that
So the prince took her for his wife
for now
he knew that he had a real princess
and the pea was put in the museum
where it may still be seen,
if no one has stolen it
There, that is a true story
A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow
Do you ever get anywhere
he asked with a mocking laugh
Yes
replied the Tortoise
and I get there sooner than you think
I will run you a race and prove it
The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise
but for the fun of the thing
he agreed
So the Fox
who had consented to act as judge
marked the distance and started the runners off
The Hare was soon far out of sight
and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare
he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up
The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily
and
after a time
passed the place where the Hare was sleeping
But the Hare slept on very peacefully
and when at last he did wake up
the Tortoise was near the goal
The Hare now ran his swiftest
but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time
Slow and steady wins the race
Once upon a time
a severe plague raged among the animals
Many died
and those who lived were so ill
that they cared for neither food nor drink
and dragged themselves about listlessly
No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner
nor a tender lamb rouses greedy Sir Wolf's appetite.
At last
the Lion decided to call a council
When all the animals were gathered together he arose and said
Dear friends
I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins
Therefore
the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice
Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all
I will confess all my sins first
I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep
They had done me no harm
I have eaten goats and bulls and stags
To tell the truth
I even ate up a shepherd now and then
Now
if I am the most guilty
I am ready to be sacrificed
But I think it best that each one confesses his sins as I have done
then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty
Your majesty
said the Fox
you are too good
Can it be a crime to eat sheep
such stupid mutton heads
No
no
your majesty
You have done them great honor by eating them up
And so far as shepherds are concerned
we all know they belong to that puny race that pretends to be our masters
All the animals applauded the Fox loudly
Then
though the Tiger
the Bear
the Wolf
and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds
all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent
It was now the Ass's turn to confess
I remember
he said guiltily
that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests
I was so tempted by the tender grass and my hunger
that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it
I had no right to do it
I admit
A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him
Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them
What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else
It was enough to hang anyone for
much more an Ass
Immediately they all fell upon him
the Wolf in the lead
and soon had made an end to him
sacrificing him to the gods then and there
and without the formality of an altar
The weak are made to suffer for the misdeeds of the powerful
Many years ago
there was an Emperor
who was so excessively fond of new clothes
that he spent all his money in dress
He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers
nor did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase
except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes
He had a different suit for each hour of the day
and as of any other king or emperor
one is accustomed to say
he is sitting in council
it was always said of him
The Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe
Time passed merrily in the large town which was his capital
strangers arrived every day at the court
One day
two rogues
calling themselves weavers
made their appearance
They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colors and elaborate patterns
the clothes manufactured from which should have the wonderful property of remaining invisible to everyone who was unfit for the office he held
or who was extraordinarily simple in character
These must
indeed
be splendid clothes
thought the Emperor
Had I such a suit
I might at once find out what men in my realms are unfit for their office
and also be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish
This stuff must be woven for me immediately
And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly
So the two pretended weavers set up two looms
and affected to work very busily
though in reality
they did nothing at all
They asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold thread
put both into their own knapsacks
and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until late at night
I should like to know how the weavers are getting on with my cloth
said the Emperor to himself
after some little time had elapsed
he was
however
rather embarrassed
when he remembered that a simpleton
or one unfit for his office
would be unable to see the manufacture
To be sure
he thought he had nothing to risk in his own person
but yet
he would prefer sending somebody else
to bring him intelligence about the weavers
and their work
before he troubled himself in the affair
All the people throughout the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to possess
and all were anxious to learn how wise
or how ignorant
their neighbors might prove to be
I will send my faithful old minister to the weavers
said the Emperor
at last
after some deliberation
he will be best able to see how the cloth looks
for he is a man of sense
and no one can be more suitable for his office than he is
So the faithful old minister went into the hall
where the knaves were working with all their might
at their empty looms
What can be the meaning of this
thought the old man, opening his eyes very wide
I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms
However
he did not express his thoughts aloud
The impostors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms
and then asked him whether the design pleased him
and whether the colors were not very beautiful
at the same time pointing to the empty frames
the poor old minister looked and looked
he could not discover anything on the looms
for a very good reason
there was nothing there
What
thought he again
Is it possible that I am a simpleton
I have never thought so myself
and no one must know it now if I am so
Can it be
that I am unfit for my office
No
that must not be said either
I will never confess that I could not see the stuff
Well
Sir Minister
said one of the knaves
still pretending to work
You do not say whether the stuff pleases you
oh
it is excellent
replied the old minister
looking at the loom through his spectacles
This pattern
and the colors
yes
I will tell the Emperor without delay
how very beautiful I think them
We shall be much obliged to you
said the impostors
and then they named the different colors and described the pattern of the pretended stuff
The old minister listened attentively to their words
in order that he might repeat them to the Emperor
and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold
saying that it was necessary to complete what they had begun
However
they put all that was given them into their knapsacks
and continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looms
The Emperor now sent another officer of his court to see how the men were getting on
and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready
It was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister
he surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all but the empty frames
Does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you, as it did to my lord the minister
asked the impostors of the Emperor's second ambassador
at the same time making the same gestures as before
and talking of the design and colors which were not there
